# Master_Thesis

This thesis was written as part of the masterâ€™s program in Statistics and Data Science at Leiden University. It focuses on finding modules of highly-correlated genes in single-cell RNA-seq data. In this thesis, we will try to use the Poisson Generalized Linear Mixed Model to estimate the correlation between genes more accurately and efficiently. This thesis project was supervised by Dr. Szymon M. Kielbasa and Prof. Dr. Jelle Goeman at Leiden University Medical Center.

## Introduction

**(1)** In the **[Simualtion](https://github.com/hansq358/Master_Thesis/tree/main/Simulation)** file, there are three R files corresponde to the three simulations in the thesis respectively. <br/>
**(2)** In the **[Evaluation_simulation](https://github.com/hansq358/Master_Thesis/tree/main/Evaluation_simulation)** file, there are three files evaluate the simulation result from simulation 2 and 3. <br/>
**(3)** In the **[Real data analysis](https://github.com/hansq358/Master_Thesis/tree/main/Real%20data%20analysis)** file, there is a R file [Get_cluster](https://github.com/hansq358/Master_Thesis/blob/main/Real%20data%20analysis/Get_cluster.Rmd) which can get the raw data, other three R files corresponde to the application on three different datasets in the thesis respectively. <br/>
